system requirement:

MATLAB R2014a

This program is a cpp file, which means you should have the gcc comppile environment. My environment is codeblocks16.01 with mingw(GCC version5.1.0).
In codeblocks you don't need any dependency to run ant.cpp. The china_cities_pos_province.csv and ant.cpp should in the same file.
1.open the codeblocks
2.click file -> open..., choose ant.cpp
3.click Build and run

proj.m file can be run after adding proj.m and map1691.mat to the MATLAB's path
